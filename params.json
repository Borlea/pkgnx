{"name":"pkgnx","tagline":"Blazing fast binary data format for video games â€“ PKG4 for Java","body":"# pkgnx #\r\npkgnx is a simple Java library for the NX file format. The format was designed by [Peter Atashian](http://github.com/retep998) and [angelsl](https://github.com/angelsl) and has a public specification available [here](http://nxformat.github.io/). The format intended on replacing the proprietary WZ data format designed by Wizet for the popular game, [MapleStory](http://www.maplestory.com).\r\n\r\n## Using pkgnx ##\r\nUsing pkgnx is really quite simple! The first step, of course, is to include the library as a dependency either by adding it to your classpath or adding it as a maven dependency. Once that's done, you can start coding away. The code itself is quite simple.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    NXFile file = new NXFile(\"path/to/file\");\r\n    file.parse();\r\n    // Do stuff, like...\r\n    System.out.println(file.getRoot().getName());\r\n    // Or...\r\n    System.out.println(file.resolve(\"Mob/8800000.img\"));\r\n```\r\n    \r\nYou can also parse the file immediately through the constructor like so:\r\n```java\r\n    NXFile file = new NXFile(\"path/to/file\", true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Contributing ##\r\nTo contribute a patch to pkgnx, simply fork it and run. When you've finished all of your commits, go ahead and send a pull request. All changes are required to match the official format specification and changes that do not fix bugs or add additional functionality will be rejected. This means no style changes!\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements ##\r\n* [Peter Atashian](http://github.com/retep998) and [angelsl](https://github.com/angelsl) for designing the PKG specification.\r\n* [Cedric Van Goethem](https://github.com/Zepheus) for creating [javanx](https://github.com/Zepheus/javanx), the PKG3 Java NX library.\r\n* [angelsl](https://github.com/angelsl) for creating [libjinx](https://github.com/angelsl/ms-libjinx), the first Java NX library.\r\n\r\n## Licensing ##\r\npkgnx is licensed under the MIT License.
